# QMLTN

This code is developed as a part of the Slovenian ARRS project **From classical to quantum machine learning with tensor networks**

The main code is in the `qmltn` dir and the executable programs should be placed in the `bin` dir. 

Right now we are using a modified version of the `torchmps` package, which is in the `qmltn` folder.

This code has been used to find good Matrix Product State classification baselines on simple image datasets. In particular MNIST, FashionMNIST, and CIFAR-10.
